### Introduction

**USP Core WAAP** serves as a crucial building block in a defense in depth strategy and mitigates the risk of exposing severe vulnerabilities. It acts as a reverse proxy in a Kubernetes cluster in front of the target web application. USP Core WAAP is a web application firewall with a broad security feature set utilizing positive and negative security policies such as [OWASP CRS](https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity-core-rule-set/) rules, request/response header filtering, cross-site request forgery ([CSRF](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)) protection, and [OpenAPI schema validation](https://openapis.org).

This scenario shows how **header filtering** can mitigate an application vulnerability prior to applying the application fix itself. To get more background about header filtering, read the [Core WAAP documentation](https://docs.united-security-providers.ch/usp-core-waap/latest/).

> &#128270; In this scenario a [demo next.js application](https://github.com/lirantal/vulnerable-nextjs-14-CVE-2025-29927) is used as a backend.

**Now, let's get started!**
